# README

This chunk of ugly code is made purely for my personal entertainment. I want to build a crypto tracker that lets me record buys and sells, and calculate the ROI on each sale as well as the total ROI. 

Online freemium services do this too, and they do it much better. But the free editions are limited in number of transactions, and sooner or later that limit will become a problem. By developing this here bunch of crap instead, I will have much worse problem that are wholly my own!

## Features

These are some of the ideas to be explored with this project:

- users: CRUD and list them,
- account holders: CRUD and list them, plus ROI per account holder,
- accounts: CRUD and list them, plus ROI per account,
- transactions: CRUD and list them, plus ROI per transaction.
